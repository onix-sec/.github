Onix is an effort to package security tools, and make them easy to use.

Where do you want your tools ?

- in your shell, use [onix-shell](https://github.com/onix-sec/onix-shell)
- in a Docker container, use [onix-docker](https://github.com/onix-sec/onix-docker)
- in a micro qemu VM, use [onix-vm](https://github.com/onix-sec/onix-vm)
- in a full VM, use [onix-iso](https://github.com/onix-sec/onix-iso)

You can also check out [nixsecpkgs](https://github.com/onix-sec/nixsecpkgs), a collection of tools build with Nix.
